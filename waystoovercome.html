            <p>Teenagers can take a few simple steps to protect themselves from cyberattacks and harmful online behavior. One of the most important things is to be careful about what you share online. Posting personal information such as your school, address, or passwords can make it easier for hackers or strangers to target you.<br><br>

            To avoid phishing, look out for fake emails or messages that ask for personal information or include suspicious links. These messages often appear real but are designed to steal your data.<br><br>

            When it comes to cyberbullying, avoid responding to hurtful messages or posts. Instead, save the evidence and report it to a trusted adult or the platform.<br><br>

            Keeping your accounts private, using strong passwords, and logging out of shared devices can also reduce the chance of someone accessing your information. Being aware of these risks helps teenagers stay safer online.</p>
