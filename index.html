            <h2>WHY ARE TEENAGERS VULNERABLE TO CYBERATTACKS?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph_2">
            <p>Teenagers are more vulnerable to cyberattacks because their brains and behaviors are still developing. Child psychologist Jeremiah Dickerson explains that a teenager’s brain is different from an adult’s because it is “reward and attention seeking,” which makes teens “impulsive by nature.”<br><br> The part of the brain that encourages risk-taking develops early, while the part that controls decision-making doesn’t fully mature until around age 24.<br><br> This means teenagers are more likely to take risks online or act without thinking about the long-term consequences.<br><br> Many teens also feel pressure to fit in with their peers, which can lead them to overshare personal information or participate in risky online trends.<br><br> As technology continues to grow, teenagers are leaving behind more digital footprints, making it easier for hackers to find and misuse their information.<br><br> All these factors make teens easier targets for cyberattacks and online manipulation.</p>
